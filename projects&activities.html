    <p><strong><a href="https://umnik.fasie.ru/mts/?ORGANIZATION_CODE=mts&PAGEN_1=6">UMNIK 2019 DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES NATIONAL GRANT AWARD WINNER</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed and patented an energy-efficient routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks (used in self-driving cars, smart homes, internet of things)</li>
      <li>The energy optimization improves energy savings by approximately 23% making it a more sustainable technology with lower level of carbon footprint and prolonging the lifetime of the equipment</li>
      <li>After presenting the network model in final round was granted 500,000 rubles to develop and advance it</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755684">DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADAPTIVE ROUTING ALGORITHM IN MANET – 2022 IEEE CONFERENCE OF YOUNG RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING (ELCONRUS)</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed an adaptive algorithm of network routing protocol selection based on the mobility of nodes</li>
      <li><strong>Example of the application:</strong> parked autonomous cars could communicate through a different protocol than moving cars which improves the energy efficiency and data transfer rate for end consumers (i.e. cars on the parking lot wouldn’t need to communicate as frequently as cars on the highway)</li>
    </ul>
